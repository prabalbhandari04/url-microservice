# URL Shortener Microservice

Submitting a full length URL into the text box generates a JSON response of a shortened URL to use. Submitting an invalid URL that doesn't follow the `https://www.example.com` format results in a JSON response containing an error instead. Node and Express are used on the back-end to implement an HTTP server for request handling. Mongoose is used in tandem with MongoDB to store converted short URLs for later use.
